# SeanFPortfolio

This application is designed to showcase my skills and things ive learned in thi class.

It utilizes react for the dom and uses the react router to swap choices depending on whats clicked in the navbar.

It utilizes bootstrap as the main css styler in all of the components and pages.

There are links to my projects in the portfolio page and a link to my resume in the resume section.

The contact page has a form to submit to send a message with your name and email.
